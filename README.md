# Legacy Mainframe to GCP Data Migration Framework

A **standardized framework** for moving data from legacy mainframe systems to Google Cloud Platform. It uses shared libraries to handle common tasks like audit, security, and error handling, while allowing each system to have its own specific configuration.

---

## Why Use This Framework?

### 1. Shared Library Foundation
Instead of rebuilding common features for every system, the framework provides five core libraries (`core`, `beam`, `orchestration`, `transform`, `tester`). This ensures that every migration follows the same high standards for data integrity and security. Detailed information can be found in our [Technical Architecture Document](./docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 2. Flexible and Extensible
The architecture is designed to work with different tools. While we provide ready-to-use patterns for **Apache Beam** (ingestion) and **dbt** (transformation), you can plug in your own tools if needed. 

**Community Driven Standards:** Anyone can contribute a new standardized pattern (called a "Golden Path") as long as it follows our [Core Governance Rules](./docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md#106-governance-for-custom-golden-paths). This model is supported by multiple teams across the **Credit Platform**, encouraging shared ownership and consistent quality.

### 3. Reliability and Visibility
The framework makes it easy to track and fix issues:
*   **Job Tracking:** Every run has a unique ID, making it easy to see exactly what happened to a specific file.
*   **FinOps & Cost Visibility:** Built-in cost estimation for BigQuery, GCS, and Pub/Sub, with automated labeling for precise cost allocation and budget management.
*   **Automatic Error Handling:** Built-in systems to retry failed tasks and move bad data to a "Dead Letter Queue" for investigation.
*   **Clear Logs:** Standardized logging that is easy to search in the Google Cloud console.

### Cloud Cost Savings

By splitting each system into three independent parts (Ingestion, Transformation, and Orchestration), we reduce infrastructure costs:

| Benefit | How it saves money |
|---------|-------------|
| **Smaller Orchestration** | The scheduler (Airflow) doesn't need heavy data processing tools installed. |
| **Efficient Ingestion** | Ingestion jobs (Dataflow) only use the resources they need for a specific task. |
| **Independent Scaling** | You can scale up ingestion for a large file without affecting the rest of the system. |
| **Faster Builds** | Smaller, focused components are faster to test and deploy. |

---

### Deployment Workflow

In a production environment (using tools like **Harness**), the framework follows a decoupled multi-repository strategy:

1.  **Libraries Monorepo**: All shared libraries (`core`, `beam`, `orchestration`, `transform`, `tester`) are managed in a single repository (e.g., `gcp-pipeline-libraries`). This repository uses `gcp-pipeline-libraries/harness-root.yaml` to orchestrate unified tagging and CI for all libraries.
2.  **Independent Deployment Repositories**: Each system component (e.g., `em-ingestion`, `em-transformation`) resides in its own dedicated repository. Each has its own `harness-ci.yaml` for independent CI/CD, allowing teams to deploy changes to specific systems without impacting others.

This structure provides global stability for shared components while maintaining local agility for specific data pipelines.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The framework is designed to be simple to use. You can set up a new migration by following our guides and using our pre-built templates.

## 🛠 Execution Guide

The framework supports local testing and cloud-based validation.

### 1. Local Environment Setup

Each part of a system has its own isolated environment. Use the setup script to get started:

```bash
# Example: Setup the ingestion part for the EM system
./scripts/setup_deployment_venv.sh em-ingestion

# Activate the environment
source deployments_embedded/em-ingestion/venv/bin/activate
```

This script sets up everything you need to develop and test locally.

### 2. Running Tests

#### Library Tests
To run all shared library tests (700+ tests):
```bash
./scripts/run_library_tests.sh
```

#### System-Specific Tests
To run tests for a specific system component (using embedded libraries):
```bash
cd deployments_embedded/em-ingestion
python -m pytest tests/unit/
```

### 3. Local Execution

#### Running Ingestion Locally
You can test ingestion on your own machine without using Google Cloud. This is great for checking if your file parsing and data rules are working correctly.

```bash
# Activate the ingestion environment
cd deployments_embedded/em-ingestion
python -m em_ingestion.pipeline.main \
    --input_file=path/to/local/file.csv \
    --output_table=project:dataset.table \
    --runner=DirectRunner \
    --temp_location=/tmp/beam-temp
```

#### Running Transformation Locally
You can also run your data transformation rules (dbt) locally:

```bash
cd deployments_embedded/em-transformation/dbt
dbt run --profiles-dir . --target dev
```

### 4. Cloud Validation

To test the full flow on Google Cloud, use the simulation script. This mimics a file arriving from a mainframe:

```bash
# Simulates a file arrival for the EM system
./scripts/gcp/06_test_pipeline.sh em

# Simulates LOA file arrival
./scripts/gcp/06_test_pipeline.sh loa
```

This script performs the following actions:
1.  Generates sample CSV data with valid HDR/TRL records.
2.  Uploads the data files to the Landing Bucket.
3.  Uploads the `.ok` trigger file.
4.  Publishes a message to the Pub/Sub topic to trigger the Airflow DAG.

   ┌────┴────┐
   ↓         ↓
gcp-pipeline-beam         gcp-pipeline-orchestration

| [`gcp-pipeline-tester`](./gcp-pipeline-libraries/gcp-pipeline-tester/) | Mocks, fixtures, base test classes | - |

### 3-Unit Deployment Model

Each system is split into 3 independent units:

| Unit | Purpose | Dependencies |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `*-ingestion` | Beam pipeline (GCS → ODP) | core, beam (NO airflow) |
| `*-transformation` | dbt models (ODP → FDP) | transform (dbt only) |
| `*-orchestration` | Airflow DAGs | core, orchestration (NO beam) |

### File Format

```
HDR|EM|CUSTOMERS|20260101           ← Header: System, Entity, Date
customer_id,name,ssn,status         ← CSV headers
1001,John Doe,123-45-6789,ACTIVE    ← Data rows
1002,Jane Smith,987-65-4321,ACTIVE
TRL|RecordCount=2|Checksum=a1b2c3d4 ← Trailer: Count, Checksum
```

### Split File Handling

Files > 25MB are split by mainframe with naming: `customers_1.csv`, `customers_2.csv`

Single `.ok` file signals all splits are complete:
```
gs://landing/em/customers/
├── customers_1.csv
├── customers_2.csv
└── customers.csv.ok    ← Triggers processing of ALL splits
```
