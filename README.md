# Legacy Mainframe to GCP Data Migration Framework

A **library-first framework** for migrating legacy mainframe batch systems to Google Cloud Platform. Shared libraries provide reusable patterns; deployments configure them per system.

## Architecture

### 4-Library Model

```
gcp-pipeline-core (Foundation - NO beam, NO airflow)
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┐
   ↓         ↓
gcp-pipeline-beam         gcp-pipeline-orchestration
(Ingestion - beam)        (Control - airflow)
```

| Library | Purpose | Tests |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `gcp-pipeline-core` | Audit, monitoring, error handling, job control | 208 |
| `gcp-pipeline-beam` | Beam pipelines, transforms, file management | 358 |
| `gcp-pipeline-orchestration` | Airflow DAGs, sensors, operators | 52 |
| `gcp-pipeline-transform` | dbt macros for audit columns, PII masking | - |
| `gcp-pipeline-tester` | Mocks, fixtures, base test classes | - |

### 3-Unit Deployment Model

Each system is split into 3 independent units:

| Unit | Purpose | Dependencies |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `*-ingestion` | Beam pipeline (GCS → ODP) | core, beam (NO airflow) |
| `*-transformation` | dbt models (ODP → FDP) | transform |
| `*-orchestration` | Airflow DAGs | core, orchestration (NO beam) |

## 🚀 The Minimalist Advantage

### Why 3 Independent Deployments?
1.  **Decoupled Scaling**: Scale Dataflow (Ingestion) for high-volume bursts without over-provisioning Airflow (Orchestration).
2.  **Failure Isolation**: A dbt syntax error (Transformation) won't stop the file from being safely landed and audited in ODP (Ingestion).
3.  **Clean Dependencies**: Airflow stays "light" (no Beam/Java dependencies), reducing environment conflicts and start-up times.
4.  **Polyglot Fit**: Use the best tool for the job—Python/Beam for complex parsing, SQL/dbt for business logic.
5.  **Simpler E2E Testing**: Each unit (Ingestion, Transformation, Orchestration) can be tested in isolation with mocked inputs, significantly shortening feedback loops and simplifying CI/CD.

### Resiliency Patterns
*   **Integrity (Reconciliation)**: Automated TRL record count vs. BigQuery row count verification.
*   **Recoverability (Idempotency)**: Every run is uniquely identified (`run_id`), allowing safe re-execution and data overwrites.
*   **Observability (Audit Trail)**: Single correlation ID links GCS files, Beam logs, and dbt transformations.
*   **Durability (DLQ)**: Invalid records are isolated to side-tables, preserving the pipeline's "Green" status for valid data.
*   **Security (Metadata-Masking)**: PII masking is defined in the schema and enforced during both Ingestion and Transformation.

### EM (Excess Management) - JOIN Pattern

- **Source**: 3 entities (Customers, Accounts, Decision)
- **ODP**: 3 tables
- **FDP**: 1 table (`em_attributes`)
- **Dependency**: Wait for all 3 entities before FDP transformation

### LOA (Loan Origination) - SPLIT Pattern

- **Source**: 1 entity (Applications)
- **ODP**: 1 table
- **FDP**: 2 tables (`event_transaction_excess`, `portfolio_account_excess`)
- **Dependency**: Immediate trigger after ODP load

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ODP** | Original Data Product - Raw 1:1 copy of mainframe data |
| **FDP** | Foundation Data Product - Transformed, business-ready |
| **HDR/TRL** | Header/Trailer records for file validation |
| **.ok file** | Signal file indicating transfer complete |
