# Legacy Mainframe to GCP Data Migration Framework

A **library-first framework** for migrating legacy mainframe batch systems to Google Cloud Platform. Shared libraries provide reusable patterns; deployments configure them per system.

---

## Why This Framework?

### 1. Library-First Architecture
The framework is built on a **4-Library Model** (`core`, `beam`, `orchestration`, `transform`) as detailed in our [Technical Architecture Document (TAD)](./docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md). It leverages **Apache Beam** and **Cloud Composer** to provide professional-grade data integrity and operational resilience (see our [Architectural Rationale](./docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md#12-architectural-rationale-why-beam--composer)).

### 2. Pluggable & Hybrid Ready
The architecture is tool-agnostic. While providing reference implementations in Beam and dbt, it is designed to integrate existing in-house ingestion or transformation tools while maintaining a unified audit and control plane via the `gcp-pipeline-core` library.

### 3. Operational Excellence
The framework prioritizes observability and reliability:
*   **Job Control & Audit:** Centralized tracking via the `job_control` table and `run_id` correlation.
*   **Standardized Error Handling:** Built-in retry/DLQ patterns.
*   **Structured Logging:** JSON logging with full context propagation.

### Cloud Cost Benefits

The **3-Unit Deployment Model** reduces cloud costs:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Smaller Airflow Environment** | Orchestration unit has NO Apache Beam dependency → faster builds, less memory |
| **Smaller Dataflow Images** | Ingestion unit has NO Airflow dependency → smaller container images |
| **Independent Scaling** | Scale ingestion workers without affecting orchestration |
| **Faster Deployments** | Smaller units = faster CI/CD pipelines |

---

### Local Development Setup

To set up a local development environment for a specific deployment, use the provided helper script. This will create a dedicated virtual environment for the deployment and install the required libraries from the local monorepo in **editable mode**.

```bash
# Example: Setup venv for loa-ingestion
./scripts/setup_deployment_venv.sh loa-ingestion

# Activate the venv
source deployments/loa-ingestion/venv/bin/activate
```

This approach ensures that changes made to libraries in the `libraries/` directory are immediately reflected in your local deployment environment.

### CI/CD Workflow

In CI/CD environments (e.g., Harness), deployments install libraries from an **Artifact Repository** (like Google Artifact Registry or Nexus) using standard `pip install`. 

The libraries are built and published independently by the [Libraries Root Pipeline](./libraries/harness-root.yaml).

## Architecture

### 4-Library Model

```
gcp-pipeline-core (Foundation - NO beam, NO airflow)
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┐
   ↓         ↓
gcp-pipeline-beam         gcp-pipeline-orchestration
(Ingestion - beam)        (Control - airflow)
```

| Library | Purpose | Tests |
|---------|---------|-------|
| [`gcp-pipeline-core`](./libraries/gcp-pipeline-core/) | Audit, monitoring, error handling, job control | 208 |
| [`gcp-pipeline-beam`](./libraries/gcp-pipeline-beam/) | Beam pipelines, transforms, file management | 358 |
| [`gcp-pipeline-orchestration`](./libraries/gcp-pipeline-orchestration/) | Airflow DAGs, sensors, operators | 52 |
| [`gcp-pipeline-transform`](./libraries/gcp-pipeline-transform/) | dbt macros for audit columns, PII masking | - |
| [`gcp-pipeline-tester`](./libraries/gcp-pipeline-tester/) | Mocks, fixtures, base test classes | - |

### 3-Unit Deployment Model

Each system is split into 3 independent units:

| Unit | Purpose | Dependencies |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `*-ingestion` | Beam pipeline (GCS → ODP) | core, beam (NO airflow) |
| `*-transformation` | dbt models (ODP → FDP) | transform (dbt only) |
| `*-orchestration` | Airflow DAGs | core, orchestration (NO beam) |

### File Format

```
HDR|EM|CUSTOMERS|20260101           ← Header: System, Entity, Date
customer_id,name,ssn,status         ← CSV headers
1001,John Doe,123-45-6789,ACTIVE    ← Data rows
1002,Jane Smith,987-65-4321,ACTIVE
TRL|RecordCount=2|Checksum=a1b2c3d4 ← Trailer: Count, Checksum
```

### Split File Handling

Files > 25MB are split by mainframe with naming: `customers_1.csv`, `customers_2.csv`

Single `.ok` file signals all splits are complete:
```
gs://landing/em/customers/
├── customers_1.csv
├── customers_2.csv
└── customers.csv.ok    ← Triggers processing of ALL splits
```
