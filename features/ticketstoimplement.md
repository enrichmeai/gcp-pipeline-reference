This document tracks the planned features and enhancements for the `gcp-pipeline-builder` library and its reference implementations.

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2026

## 1. Library Core Implementation

### TICKET-110: Automated PII Masking Transform
**Status:** 🔲 TODO
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:**
Create a reusable `MaskPIIDoFn` Beam transform that automatically masks fields marked with `is_pii=True` in the schema before writing to BigQuery.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Target File:** `libraries/gcp-pipeline-beam/src/gcp_pipeline_beam/pipelines/beam/transforms.py`.
- **Logic:** The `DoFn` will inspect the `EntitySchema`, identify fields with `is_pii=True`, and apply a masking strategy (e.g., hash or constant string) to those values in the record dictionary.
- **Integration:** Should be optionally insertable into the `BasePipeline` before the BigQuery write step.
- **Config:** Masking character and strategy should be configurable via pipeline options.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Automated:** No manual logic needed in system-specific pipelines beyond setting `is_pii=True` in the schema.
- **Verified:** Unit tests showing that PII-flagged fields are masked in the output PCollection.
- **Compliant:** that BigQuery ODP tables contain masked data for sensitive fields.

- **Content:**
    - The problem of duplicated migration effort across teams.
    - The "Library Built Once, Deployments Configured Per Team" philosophy.
    - Deep dive into Metadata-Driven Validation, Reconciliation, and Masking.
    - Case studies using the EM (JOIN) and LOA (SPLIT) patterns.
    - Resilience and Observability (OTEL/Dynatrace integration).
- **Format:** Markdown (for Git) and PDF (for distribution).

**Success Criteria:**
- **Review:** Approved by the lead enterprise architect.
- **Completeness:** Covers all core principles defined in the root `README.md`.
