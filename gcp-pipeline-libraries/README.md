# Libraries

> **Current Version:** 1.0.29 (all 6 libraries aligned)

4-library architecture for mainframe-to-GCP data migration, following a **Golden Path** pattern demonstrated through production-ready reference deployments. Two supplementary packages (`gcp-pipeline-tester` for testing utilities, `gcp-pipeline-framework` as the umbrella package) complete the ecosystem.

These libraries provide **generic mechanisms** (sensors, operators, macros, validators) — all system-specific logic is **config-driven** via `system.yaml` files in each deployment. No library code changes are needed when onboarding a new system.

---

## Golden Path — Reference Deployments

The libraries are demonstrated through a complete end-to-end pipeline (the "Generic" system):

```
Mainframe files → GCS landing bucket
                       ↓ (.ok trigger file → Pub/Sub notification)
              data-pipeline-orchestrator (Airflow DAG)
                       ↓ (triggers Dataflow job)
           original-data-to-bigqueryload (Apache Beam)
                       ↓ (loads into ODP tables)
              BigQuery ODP (customers, accounts, decision, applications)
                       ↓
           bigquery-to-mapped-product (dbt: ODP → FDP)
                       ↓ (joins, maps, PII masking)
              BigQuery FDP (event_transaction_excess, portfolio_account_excess, ...)
                       ↓
           fdp-to-consumable-product (dbt: FDP → CDP)
                       ↓ (complex business logic — hand-written SQL)
              BigQuery CDP (customer_risk_profile, ...)
```

Each deployment has its own `config/system.yaml` containing **only** the configuration relevant to that layer — no cross-layer coupling.

| Deployment | Layer | Config Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `original-data-to-bigqueryload` | ODP | entities (full field definitions), infrastructure |
| `data-pipeline-orchestrator` | Orchestration | entities (slim), fdp_models (type + requires only) |
| `bigquery-to-mapped-product` | FDP | entities, staging code maps, fdp_models (full column mappings) |
| `fdp-to-consumable-product` | CDP | fdp_models (output columns), cdp_models (metadata for hand-written SQL) |

Reference packages are published to PyPI: `gcp-pipeline-ref-ingestion`, `gcp-pipeline-ref-transform`, `gcp-pipeline-ref-orchestration`, `gcp-pipeline-ref-cdp`.

See [GOLDEN_PATH_PROPOSAL.md](../docs/GOLDEN_PATH_PROPOSAL.md) for the full architecture and [DBT_CONFIG_DRIVEN_SPEC.md](../docs/DBT_CONFIG_DRIVEN_SPEC.md) for the config-driven dbt specification.

## Current Capabilities vs. Prioritized Roadmap

This library is designed as a **Best-in-Class Foundation** for Mainframe-to-GCP migrations, prioritizing architectural integrity and operational reliability.

### 🚀 What We Have (Current Capabilities)

*   **Zero-Bleed Portability**: Strict separation of concerns. `gcp-pipeline-core` has zero dependencies on Beam or Airflow, making it usable in any Python environment (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, etc.).
*   **Idempotency by Design**: Built-in `AuditTrail` and `DuplicateDetector` ensure that pipeline restarts do not result in duplicate data, a critical requirement for financial migrations.
*   **Local Development Stubbing**: Innovative "Airflow-free" and "Beam-free" testing stubs allow for DAG and transform validation without a live GCP environment.
*   **Schema-Driven Governance**: Centralized `EntitySchema` definitions drive automated validation, PII masking, and BigQuery schema generation.
*   **In-flight PII Masking (`MaskPIIDoFn`)**: Automatically masks SSN, EMAIL, FULL, PARTIAL, and REDACTED field types during Beam processing before records reach BigQuery. Driven by `EntitySchema.is_pii` and `pii_type` field flags.
*   **Metadata-Driven Enrichment**: Reusable dbt macros that interpret enrichment rules from metadata, keeping transformation logic project-agnostic.

### 🔴 Absolute Must (Production Readiness)

These items are critical for achieving a production-ready state and ensuring data security and operational integrity:

*   **E2E Validation**: Final verification of the `run_id` lineage across all 5 libraries and deployment units.
*   **BigQuery Partitioning**: Mandatory implementation of partitioning in dbt models (using `extract_date`) to prevent cost overruns and ensure query performance.
*   **Audit & Reconciliation Hardening**: Verification of source-to-target counts via the `AuditTrail` and `JobControl` repository.
*   **Terraform & IAM Consistency**: Ensuring service account permissions are strictly aligned across all environments.

### 🔮 Future Enhancements (Modernization)

To evolve from an Excellent Enterprise Framework to a State-of-the-Art GCP Architecture:

*   **Dataplex Integration**: Moving from manual `is_pii` flags to **GCP Dataplex** for automated data discovery and column-level security via BigQuery Policy Tags.
*   **GCP-Native SQL (Dataform)**: Transitioning shared macros to **Google Dataform** for a more integrated experience within the Google Cloud Console.
*   **Modern Format Support**: Expanding `BeamPipelineBuilder` to include native `read_avro()` and `read_parquet()` support.
*   **Operational Dashboarding**: Automated generation of Looker Studio dashboards directly from the `job_control` and `audit_trail` BigQuery tables.
*   **Enhanced DQ Shields**: Implementing advanced data quality checks (e.g., zero-byte detection, EBCDIC artifact cleanliness).

## Library Breakdown

### 1. gcp-pipeline-core (The Foundation)
*   **Purpose**: Essential utilities for auditing, error handling, monitoring, and job control.
*   **Key Findings**:
    *   **Audit Trail**: Implements `AuditTrail` and `DuplicateDetector` for robust data lineage and idempotent processing.
    *   **Error Handling**: Sophisticated `ErrorClassifier` categorizing exceptions (Validation, Integration, Resource) and mapping to `RetryPolicy` (Exponential Backoff, Manual Only).
    *   **Job Control**: Tracks pipeline execution state in BigQuery, enabling granular status updates and failure stage tracking.
    *   **Compliance**: Strictly adheres to the "NO beam, NO airflow" rule. This ensures the foundation remains lightweight and portable.

### 2. gcp-pipeline-beam (Ingestion Layer)
*   **Purpose**: Data ingestion and record-level processing using Apache Beam.
*   **Key Findings**:
    *   **HDR/TRL Parser**: Highly configurable regex-based parser for mainframe headers and trailers, supporting custom patterns.
    *   **Schema Validation**: Robust `SchemaValidator` for record validation against `EntitySchema` using global, metadata-driven PII masking (no regional assumptions like SSN).
    *   **Fluent API**: `BeamPipelineBuilder` for a clean, chainable interface (`read` -> `validate` -> `transform` -> `write`).
    *   **Compliance**: Depends on `core` and `beam`; avoids `airflow` dependencies.

### 3. gcp-pipeline-orchestration (Control Layer)
*   **Purpose**: Pipeline execution and event-driven triggers using Airflow.
*   **Key Findings**:
    *   **Dataflow Operators**: `BaseDataflowOperator` supporting Classic and Flex templates with a local development stubbing mechanism.
    *   **Pub/Sub Sensors**: `BasePubSubPullSensor` for event-driven orchestration via GCS notifications, extracting metadata to XCom.
    *   **Compliance**: Depends on `core` and `airflow`; avoids `beam` dependencies.

### 4. gcp-pipeline-transform (SQL/dbt Layer)
*   **Purpose**: Shared dbt macros for post-ingestion transformations and data quality.
*   **Key Findings**:
    *   **Audit Macros**: `add_audit_columns()` ensures consistent lineage tracking across all models.
    *   **PII Masking**: Metadata-driven masking engine using generic strategies (`FULL`, `PARTIAL`, `REDACTED`) to protect sensitive data without making assumptions about its format.
    *   **Enrichment**: Metadata-driven enrichment mechanism supporting date parts, bucketing, and lookups.
    *   **Safety**: `validate_no_pii_in_export` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

### 5. gcp-pipeline-tester (Testing Utility)
*   **Purpose**: Standardized mocks and testing infrastructure.
*   **Key Findings**:
    *   **Mocks**: Rich set of GCS and BigQuery mocks ensuring unit tests don't require live GCP connectivity.
    *   **Unified CI**: Integrated for a unified release strategy.

gcp-pipeline-trans  dbt                     beam, airflow
```

---

## Governance & Recommendations

To maintain the integrity of the library architecture, the following rules and recommendations must be strictly followed:

### 1. Dependency Enforcement (NO Cross-Pollination)
*   **gcp-pipeline-core** is the foundation. It **MUST NOT** contain any dependencies on Apache Beam or Apache Airflow. This ensures it remains lightweight and portable for use in any environment (Cloud Functions, local scripts, etc.).
*   **gcp-pipeline-beam** must only depend on `core` and `beam`. No Airflow logic or operators should be present here.
*   **gcp-pipeline-orchestration** must only depend on `core` and `airflow`. No Beam pipelines or record-level transforms should be present here.

### 2. Testing Standards
*   Every new feature in a library must be accompanied by unit tests using `gcp-pipeline-tester`.
*   **BDD Expansion**: Complex multi-stage pipelines should include BDD-style scenarios (using the `bdd/` module in `gcp-pipeline-tester`) to validate end-to-end integration logic without live GCP resources.

### 3. Strict Genericity (NO Project-Specific Logic)
*   Libraries provide **mechanisms**, not business rules. 
*   **NEVER** hardcode values, entity names, or logic specific to a single system (e.g., "Application1" or "Application2") inside the library code.
*   Use **Metadata-Driven** patterns: Logic should be controlled by configurations (schemas, variables, or rules) passed from the deployment layer.
*   Example: Use a generic `apply_enrichment(rules)` macro instead of an `apply_application1_enrichment()` macro.

### 4. Release & Tagging Strategy
*   Use the **Unified Tagging Strategy** for cross-library changes.
*   Version tags (e.g., `libs-1.0.x`) must be applied to the monorepo root to ensure a consistent state is captured for production deployments.

- `check_required_fields(table, fields)`: completeness with configurable threshold
- `check_uniqueness(table, key)`: duplicate key detection
- `check_value_range(table, column, min, max)`: numeric bounds validation
- `check_pattern_match(table, column, pattern)`: regex format validation
- `check_freshness(table, column, max_age_hours)`: staleness detection
- `generic_not_null_and_unique(model, column)`: reusable dbt test macro

## Config-Driven dbt Generation

FDP and CDP dbt models are auto-generated from `system.yaml` using a shared generator script:

```bash
# Generate FDP models (staging views, source YAML, FDP SQL)
python generate_dbt_models.py --layer fdp --config config/system.yaml

# Generate CDP scaffolding (FDP staging views, source YAML, metadata)
python generate_dbt_models.py --layer cdp --config config/system.yaml
```

Three model types are supported: **MAP** (1:1 column rename), **JOIN** (multi-source with join conditions), and **CUSTOM** (hand-written SQL — generator produces scaffolding only). FDP models are typically MAP/JOIN; CDP models are typically CUSTOM.

## Separate Repository Migration Guide

If you decide to move these libraries to separate repositories, follow these steps to maintain integrity and ensure proper integration.

### 1. Repository Structure
Each library is already self-contained with its own `pyproject.toml`, `src/` directory, and `tests/`.
*   Initialize your new Git repository: `gcp-pipeline-libraries`.
*   You can choose to keep them in one repo (as you have done with `gcp-pipeline-libraries`) or move them to individual repos.
*   Move the contents of the library folders to the root or designated subdirectories of the new repository.

### 2. Dependency Management
*   Update `pyproject.toml` to include internal library dependencies via private PyPI (Artifact Registry) or direct Git URLs.
*   Example for `gcp-pipeline-beam` in its new repo:
    ```toml
    dependencies = [
        "gcp-pipeline-core @ git+https://github.com/your-org/gcp-pipeline-libraries.git#subdirectory=gcp-pipeline-core",
        "apache-beam[gcp]==2.56.0",
    ]
    ```

### 3. CI/CD Adjustments
If you move libraries to separate repositories, you will need to set up independent CI/CD pipelines for each.

### 4. dbt Integration (for Transform Library)
When `gcp-pipeline-transform` moves to a separate repo, update `packages.yml` in deployment projects:
```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/your-org/gcp-pipeline-transform.git"
    revision: v1.0.0
```

## Contribution & Future Development

To contribute to this framework, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Zero-Bleed Compliance
Every PR must be audited to ensure no dependency leakage occurs between layers (e.g., ensuring no Airflow imports in Beam transforms).

### 2. Generic-First Implementation
Before adding a new validator or macro, ask: "Can this be used by any system in any region?".
*   Avoid US-specific or UK-specific logic in the library core.
*   Use parameters and metadata-driven patterns to handle regional variations.

### 3. Testing Mandate
*   New features must have >90% test coverage.
*   Use `gcp-pipeline-tester` mocks to ensure tests are fast and environment-independent.

## CI/CD - Automation
Each library is designed for independent build and test cycles. A unified tagging strategy allows orchestrating all library builds and applying a unified version tag across the monorepo.

### Unified Tagging Strategy
When changes are made across multiple libraries, you can apply a unified Git tag (e.g., `libs-1.0.x`) to the entire repository. This ensures that a specific state of the monorepo is captured as a single release point, even though libraries can still be built and tested individually.

---

## Run Tests

You can now run tests for each library using `pytest` directly from its directory, as the `pythonpath` is configured in `pyproject.toml` or `pytest.ini`.

```bash
# Run with Python 3.11
cd gcp-pipeline-core
python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Beam
cd ../gcp-pipeline-beam
python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Orchestration
cd ../gcp-pipeline-orchestration
python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Transform
cd ../gcp-pipeline-transform
python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Tester
cd ../gcp-pipeline-tester
python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Alternatively, you can run tests for all libraries from the project root:
```bash
./scripts/run_library_tests.sh
```

## Total: 737 tests passing

| Library | Tests |
|---------|-------|
| gcp-pipeline-core | 219 |
| gcp-pipeline-beam | 359 |
| gcp-pipeline-orchestration | 58 |
| gcp-pipeline-tester | 101 |
| **Total** | **737** |

## 🛠 Execution Guide

### 1. Running Library Tests
You can run tests for all libraries from the project root:
```bash
./scripts/run_library_tests.sh
```

Or for an individual library:
```bash
cd gcp-pipeline-libraries/gcp-pipeline-core
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/
```

### 2. Local DAG/Transform Validation
The libraries are designed for "Local-First" development. You can validate DAG syntax and Beam transforms without a GCP environment by using the built-in mocks and stubs.

**Example: Validate DAG syntax**
```bash
cd deployments/data-pipeline-orchestrator
python dags/generic_pubsub_trigger_dag.py # Works due to AIRFLOW_AVAILABLE stub
```

**Example: Test Beam transform with mocks**
```bash
cd gcp-pipeline-libraries/gcp-pipeline-beam
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/transforms/test_parsers.py
```

### 3. Integrated Testing
To test the integration between libraries, use the `Dual-Run` comparison utility in `gcp-pipeline-tester` which allows you to compare outputs from different pipeline versions.
